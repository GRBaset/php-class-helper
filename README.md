## How do you do all of that?
The default keybinding is `ctrl+shift+c`, but you are free to change it however you like. This simple keybinding is all you need to add a class, constructor and properties.

## Settings

You can tweak the visibility of a property:

`php-class-helper.visibility: "private"`

## Known issues

Needs a couple of second to start to work correctly.

## Idea

This extension is inspired by sublime [php companion](https://github.com/erichard/SublimePHPCompanion) package. 
Hope you like this extension :)
